<h3>My favorite food is mac and cheese and yes it is a main dish just like fettuccine or spaghetti. 
My <b>favorite</b> things about mac and cheese are how <b>customisable</b> it is with noodle type, cheeses, and toppings.
I also love how <b>easy</b> it is, cup mac is dorm friendly and now in my own home it takes less than 10 minutes to make a box mix.
